		<div class="info">Probably our most successful campaign has been the launch of the weekday daily newsletter, City Pigeon.<br><br>
		City Pigeon is a fun packaging of <i>City Paper</i> content. For this design we decided to go in a bit of a different direction than our usual branding. We took the mascot, a Pigeon to be the "carrier" of news. The Pigeon opens each header and closes the footer within it containing a featured story, other content, sposored content, and events happening in Pittsburgh.

		<div class="info">Throughout my time with <i>City Paper</i>, our top priorities have been to develop a more cohesive brand. In this effort we made numerous changes to the website visuals.<br><br>
		For the website I made mockup designs in Figma to help illustrate the design changes we wanted to make on the website. Then by coordinating over phone calls and emails, the developers at Foundation were able to make most of the design changes we wanted.
