		<div class="info">During my time at the <i>City Paper</i> we formed a small team between our sales and editorial dempoartments to guide the direction of our branding and make more successful efforts to raise our revenue.  <br><br> 
		One of our biggest new changes was creating logomarks and branding for our two biggest events, Pittsburgh's People of the Year and Best of PGH. In previous years, the newspaper had created a new theme and visual language for each year. We decided to make an open visual language and brand identity so that these two events would be recognizable from year to year. 
		<br><br>Additionally, I led project and participated in meetings with developers to refresh our webpage and give readers ease of access to content, while raising our impact rates.<br><br>
