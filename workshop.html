				<td class="right">I had the idea of making a publication about climate change as this issue is getting more and more out of hand. I have been feeling frustrated every time billionaires have been going into space saying how much it makes you respect the earth to see it from space. If they really respected it, maybe they should consider using their money for helping save it then? 
I'm still unsure of the direction I want to take this project. I'm considering what it would be to just merely make a book of images, a sort of homage to the earth. Or maybe something inspired by Powers of 10 by the Eames. I am also really inspired by some of my favorite magazines: Icarus Complex, MOLD, Deem, and Emergence.
For this magazine, I really want to use beautiful pictures of the earth and humanity both of nature thriving and dying. While using stock photos, I also want to use pictures I took in Iceland in 2018. These are pictured below.
Update: This little zine will be a half satirical piece on the issue of human engagement with climate change. I'm officially calling it a doomsday magazine, counting down the days we have. Selected articles for this zine include: Hot in My Backyard from This American Life, It's Not the Heat, It's the Damage by Bill McKibben, The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells. I'm calling it a Doomsday Mag. I had the great idea to make the page numbers count down through the book instead of up.</td>
