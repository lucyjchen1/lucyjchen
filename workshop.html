		<div class="info">Doomsday Mag<br><br>I had the idea of making a publication about climate change as this issue is getting more and more out of hand. I have been feeling frustrated every time billionaires have been going into space saying how much it makes you respect the earth to see it from space. If they really respected it, maybe they should consider using their money for helping save it then? <br><br>This little zine will be a half satirical piece on the issue of human engagement with climate change. I'm officially calling it a doomsday magazine, counting down the days we have. Similarly the pages will count down instead of up. Selected articles for this zine include: "Hot in My Backyard" from This American Life, "It's Not the Heat, It's the Damage" by Bill McKibben, "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells. </div><div class="images">

		Comic<br><br>I'm collaborating with my good friend from college, <a href="https://www.alanatheartist.com/">Alana Korol</a>, to write and draw a comic. We meet weekly to plan out the comic and are just finishing the overarching plot. The comic is a fantasy, LGBTQ+ romance, of a knight who is loyal to her kingdom who meets a witch and discover hidden corruption. I've been using <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a> to help brainstorm ideas and locations.</div><div class="images">

		Self-Reflection<br><br>Recently completed, but still in my thoughts. I organized a collaborative zine project where each piece had a different writer, artist, and designer. I was so excited to work with my friends after so long. Here are some of the pieces I contributed, as well as the cover and table of contents which I designed.</div><div class="images">

		Christmas Cards<br><br>I started this annual project in 2018 when I was first introduced to the idea of lettering. Since then I've added lettering into my design practice especially for <a href="___">Pittsburgh City Paper</a> and my personal <a href="__">book covers</a> projects. Each year I design a new typographically-driven card for the holidays and send it to both relatives and friends.<br><br> <i>From left to right, card design for 2020, 2021, and 2022. </i></div><div class="images">

		36 Days of Type<br><br>In 2022 I was finally able to complete the full #36daysoftype challenge where each day you create a typographical image around a single letter. Here are a few of my favorites. The full set can be found on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lucyjchen/?hl=en">Instagram</a>.</div><div class="images">

		Midjourney<br><br>Ever since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html">Jason Allen made national news after winning an art competition with AI generated work</a>, I've been really interested in the capabilities of AI, specifically <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a>. I got Midjourney and was instantly addicted to the multitude of images it could create. This zine is based off the poem, <i>The Tyger</i> by William Blake, but instead the lines have been input into Midjourney and become images. This was an awesome first project experiment and I really hope to do more with Midjourney after this project.</div><div class="images">

		<div class="info">Risograph<br><br>My mother is also an artist and graphic novelist. Recently we started a project together where I taught her how to set up a risoprint. Our illustrations are done and now we are just waiting to get it printed! Unfortunately the closest risoprinter I can find is all the way in Columbus. My illustration is an illustration of a song by <a href="https://genius.com/Heather-dale-the-maiden-and-the-selkie-lyrics">Heather Dale "The Maiden and the Selkie."</a></div>

		Carp Backpack<br><br>This isn't really a design project but something I've been working on in my spare time that I'm very excited about. This is a cosplay piece for the otome in the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGHXqjCbyEQ&ab_channel=RottenTomatoesIndie"><i>The Night is Short, Walk on Girl</i></a>. In this movie, the otome wins a shooting game at a festival and wins this giant carp backpack jacket. I just love it so much I wanted to design and make it myself.</div><div class="images">
